This Python code demonstrates basic operations on a list data structure, showcasing how to create, manipulate, and query lists efficiently. Here's what the code does:

1. Create an Empty List: Initializes an empty list called my_list.
2. Appending Elements: Adds elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list using the append() method.
3. Inserting an Element: Inserts the value 15 at the second position (index 1) in the list using the insert() method.
4. Extending the List: Adds multiple elements [50, 60, 70] to the list using the extend() method, effectively merging another list.
5. Removing the Last Element: Removes the last item from the list (70) using the pop() method.
6. Sorting the List: Arranges the list in ascending order using the sort() method.
7. Finding an Element's Index: Searches for the value 30 in the list and returns its index using the index() method.
Finally, the list's contents and the index of the value 30 are printed. This code highlights the flexibility of Python lists for dynamic modifications and queries.
